***Titanic Survivorship***

Objective: To review and analyze data from the Titanic and model survivorship based on passanger details.

Taking a look at the data by age alone, we can see that the age skews younger with a median age of 28. If we add class and survivorship, 
it becomes very obvious that the largest number of deaths came from third class males. We also start to see that women stood a better chance
of survival especially in the higher classes.

When we put the same information in terms of percentage of survivors, we get a good picture of who survived and the liklihood of survival in
each class. Half of all women in third class survived, and more than 90% of women in second and first classes survived. Men, on the other hand,
have survival rates in first, second, and third classes of 37%, 16%, and 14%, respectively.
