Tim Tirrell, Data Scientist and Problem Solver.

### More Information

 I worked for 10 years as an engineer in different capacities and wanted to focus this experience and take data analysis a step further. I'm now able to explore a data set to find hidden trends/correlations, build predictive models, and visualize data to tell a story that will ultimately lead to better business decisions.
